It is still under development so use it at your\r\nown risk. Currently only gremlin-android-java is supported because I have\r\nnot yet been able to port groovy on Android. I have heard of projects like\r\n[discobot](http://code.google.com/p/discobot/) but as far as I know the\r\nproject has little to none activity now. You may refer to Gremlin's\r\n[Java usage](https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki/Using-Gremlin-through-Java)\r\npage.\r\n\r\n\r\nIncluding in Your Project\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are two ways to include the library in your projects:\r\n\r\n1. You can download the released jar file in the [Downloads section](https://github.com/wuman/gremlin-android/downloads).\r\n2. If you use Maven to build your project you can simply add a dependency to \r\n   the desired component of the library.\r\n\r\n        <dependency>\r\n            <groupId>com.wu-man</groupId>\r\n            <artifactId>gremlin-android-java</artifactId>\r\n            <version>2.1.0.0</version>\r\n        </dependency>\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is Gremlin\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nGremlin is a domain specific language for traversing property \r\n[graphs](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_%28mathematics%29). Gremlin makes \r\nuse of [Pipes](http://pipes.tinkerpop.com) to perform complex graph traversals. \r\nThis language has application in the areas of graph query, analysis, and \r\nmanipulation. Connectors, provided by [Blueprints](http://blueprints.tinkerpop.com)\r\nand [Blueprints-Android](http://wuman.github.com/blueprints-android/), exist \r\nfor the following graph management systems:\r\n\r\n* Graph database connectivity:\r\n    * [TinkerGraph](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints/wiki/TinkerGraph) in-memory graph\r\n    * [Neo4j](http://neo4j.org/) graph database\r\n    * [OrientDB](http://www.orientechnologies.com/) graph database\r\n    * [DEX](http://www.sparsity-technologies.com/dex) graph database\r\n    * [InfiniteGraph](http://www.infinitegraph.com/) graph database\r\n    * [Titan](http://thinkaurelius.github.com/titan/) graph database\r\n    * [Rexster](http://rexster.tinkerpop.com) graph server\r\n    * [Sesame 2.0](http://www.openrdf.org) compliant RDF stores\r\n* Supporting extensions:\r\n    * [GraphML Reader/Writer](http://graphml.graphdrawing.org/) library\r\n    * [GraphSON Reader/Writer](http://www.json.org/) library\r\n    * [GML Reader/Writer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_Modelling_Language) library\r\n    * [Java Universal/Graph](http://jung.sourceforge.net/) framework\r\n* JVM language connectivity:\r\n    * [Java](http://java.com/): Gremlin in the Java Language\r\n    * [Groovy](http://groovy.codehaus.org/): Gremlin in the Groovy Language\r\n    * Easy to connect to other [JVM languages](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_JVM_languages)\r\n\r\nThe documentation for Gremlin can be found at this [location](http://gremlin.tinkerpop.com). \r\nFinally, please visit [TinkerPop](http://tinkerpop.com) for other software products.\r\n\r\n\r\nDeveloped By\r\n------------\r\n\r\n* Android porting contributor\r\n    * David Wu - <david@wu-man.com> - [http://blog.wu-man.com](http://blog.wu-man.com)\r\n* Original contributor to Gremlin\r\n    * Marko A.
